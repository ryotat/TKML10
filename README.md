# Trace norm regularization for the estimation of low-rank tensors

You can download Matlab scripts that reproduce the results in our technical report [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0789|"On the extension of trace norm to tensors"]] from this page.

## Instructions
 1. Download the [[attachment:tensor.tar.gz|scripts]], and extract them. You can also [[http://www.ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ryotat/tensor/release/|preview]] them before downloading.
 1. Also download the [[http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox|N-way toolbox]] (for comparison).
 1. Open Matlab and type
```matlab
 test_compare;
```
 to get Figure 1, 
```matlab
 test_threshold;
```
 to get Figure 2.

## Results
You should get something like this
