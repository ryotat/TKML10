# Trace norm regularization for the estimation of low-rank tensors

Note: this is made available mainly for reproducibility. Please have a look into the [latest version](https://github.com/ryotat/tensor).

You can download Matlab scripts that reproduce the results in our technical report ["On the extension of trace norm to tensors"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0789) from this page.

## Instructions
 1. Download and extract. 
 1. Also download the [N-way toolbox](http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox) (for comparison).
 1. Open Matlab and type
```matlab
 test_compare;
```
 to get Figure 1, 
```matlab
 test_threshold;
```
 to get Figure 2.

## Results
You should get something like this
